# coin-pocket-escape
A plugin using the NwPluginAPI that enables you to flip a coin to escape the pocket dimension. 

# Information
Gives players a possibility to flip a coin in the pocket dimension to get out of it.
Tails teleports the player to a room in the Heavy Containment Zone and deletes the coin, heads just deletes the coin.

# Installation
Place the `coin_pocket_escape.dll` in your plugin folder.

`SCP Secret Laboratory/PluginAPI/plugins/global` or `SCP Secret Laboratory/PluginAPI/plugins/YOURPORT`

# Configuration
You can set the time to wait after the coin is flipped (in ms). This lets the coin-flip animation play.

Also you can set if the result should be randomized. This means that it's randomized if heads or tails gets you out of the pocket dimension.
