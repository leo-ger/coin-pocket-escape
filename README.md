# coin-pocket-escape
A plugin using the NwPluginAPI that enables you to flip a coin to escape the pocket dimension. 

# Information
Gives players a possibility to flip a coin in the pocket dimension to get out of it.
If successful, the player of SCP-106 will receive a message that a player has escaped with a coin.
The player is teleported to a room in the Heavy Containment Zone and the coin is deleted.
After the Nuke explodes, the players spawn at the surface zone.
If it was not successful, the coin is simply deleted. 
At the beginning of the round, additional coins will spawn in lockers all over the map.
It is still possible to escape the pocket dim the normal way.
